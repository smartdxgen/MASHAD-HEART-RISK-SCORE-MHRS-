## XAI for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Middle Eastern Populations
## Enhancing Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Middle Eastern Populations: Explainable AI vs Conventional Models
CVD Risk Prediction in Middle Eastern Populations: XAI vs Traditional Models

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and resources for a study comparing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques with conventional logistic regression models to predict 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Middle Eastern populations. The study leverages data from the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) cohort and demonstrates the superiority of machine learning (CatBoost) in capturing non-linear interactions among risk factors.

## Key Features
**Comparative Analysis**:Evaluates logistic regression (LR) against six ML models (CatBoost, Random Forest, etc.).
**Best-performing model**:  --> CatBoost (AUC: 0.89) vs. LR (AUC: 0.70â€“0.72).
**Explainable AI (XAI) Integration**: Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model decisions and identify top risk factors (e.g., age-diabetes interactions, systolic blood pressure). Provides visualizations (force plots, summary plots) for clinical transparency.
**Optimized Feature Selection**: Reduces 33 risk factors to 14 SHAP-derived features with minimal performance drop (AUC: 0.84).
**Clinical Applicability**: Case studies illustrate high/low-risk predictions with actionable insights for cardiologists.
