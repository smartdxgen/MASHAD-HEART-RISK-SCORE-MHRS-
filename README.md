Enhancing Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Middle Eastern Populations: Explainable AI vs Conventional Models
Abstract
Introduction: Most contemporary cardiovascular risk prediction tools, including the ASCVD, SCORE2, and Framingham risk scores, employ multivariate regression techniques that assume linear relationships between risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. These models often calibrate baseline risk factors (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status) using population-specific statistical adjustments to optimize performance. This study aimed to identify an optimal combination of risk factors derived from ASCVD, SCORE2, and Framingham scores, and to compare logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) models for CVD risk prediction in a Middle Eastern cohort.
Methods: We analyzed data from 9,489 participants in the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) cohort study. LR models were first developed using risk factors from the ASCVD, SCORE2, and Framingham scores. Subsequently,  six ML algorithms—including Random Forest, CatBoost, etc.—were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive set of risk factors, with the highest-performing model selected based on accuracy. Explainable AI via Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was applied to identify the most important risk factors contributing to model decisions.
Results: The highest-performing ML model (CatBoost) on the comprehensive risk factor set achieved superior performance (AUC: 0.89; sensitivity: 95%; specificity: 40.4%) compared with LR models (AUC: 0.7–0.718; sensitivity: 0.006–0.011; specificity: 0.998–0.999). SHAP analysis identified 14 key risk factors, and retraining ML models on this subset yielded only a modest (p-value<0.001) decline in performance (AUC: 0.84; sensitivity: 90.3%; specificity: 40.8%).
Conclusion: Explainable ML models incorporating an optimized combination of risk factors outperform traditional LR approaches for CVD risk prediction in Middle Eastern populations.
